\section{Introduction}
% TODO: Talk about monophonic?
Pitch estimation, which is also referred to as f0 estimation, is an important subtask within the field of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). The goal of pitch estimation is to estimate the pitch or fundamental frequency $f_0$ of a given signal. In the context of AMT, pitch estimation is used to determine what note is played in a given signal.

Real-time pitch estimation is a subproblem where we want to estimate the note associated with the measured pitch while the musician is playing it with minimal latency. This entails we have to use the latest received signal. In contrast to non-real-time methods, we have no knowledge of what may happen ahead of time and signal corresponding to previous notes is irrelevant. This limits the methods we can use to solve this problem.

If pitch estimation can accurately be performed in real-time, it can be used to create a digital (MIDI) instrument from an acoustic instrument. This digital instrument can then be used as an input for audio synthesizers, allowing musicians to produce sounds from a wide variety of instruments. Furthermore, accurate real-time pitch estimation can be used to automatically correct detuned instruments by pitch shifting the original signal to the closest harmonious note.

% The Fourier transform is often used to decompose a signal into the frequencies that make up the signal. Predominant frequencies in the signal show up as spectral peaks in the frequency domain. These peaks are important to human perception~\cite{hearing}.

We will focus on monophonic pitch estimation. Here, we assume that the signal contains at most one note. It is much easier to perform monophonic pitch estimation compared to polyphonic pitch estimation, especially when using Fourier transform based methods, as fundamental limits of the Fourier transform inhibit our ability to discern two low pitched notes~\cite{nopoly}. Furthermore, hexaphonic guitar pickups are becoming more widespread, which allows us to view the guitar as six monophonic instruments instead of one six-way polyphonic instrument.

This thesis builds upon a preliminary research project~\cite{ik}. In our research project, we found that Fourier transform based pitch estimation methods might not be well suited for real-time use due to fundamental limitations of the Fourier transform. In this work, we will further research if Fourier transform based methods are viable, as real-time transcription research often relies Fourier transform based methods.

The goal of this thesis is to research the limits of Fourier transform based real-time pitch estimation. To correctly assess the limits, we develop a pitch estimation framework which is available at \url{www.github.com/lucmans/digistring}. This framework will focus on extensibility and the ability to perform automated tests. This is important, as much work in this field does not provide its associated source code. This limits the ability to build on other's work and hinders direct comparisons between different methods. Our framework can provide a common ground for the different methods and algorithms to be implemented and compared in.
