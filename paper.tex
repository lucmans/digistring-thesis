\section{Introduction}
% TODO: Talk about monophonic?
Pitch estimation, which is also referred to as f0 estimation, is an important subtask within the field of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). The goal of pitch estimation is to estimate the pitch or fundamental frequency $f_0$ of a given signal. In the context of AMT, pitch estimation is used to determine what note is played in a given signal.

In this thesis, we will focus on real-time pitch estimation, meaning we want to estimate the note associated with the measured pitch while the musician is playing it with minimal latency. This entails we have to use the latest received signal. In contrast to non-real-time methods, we have no knowledge of what may happen ahead of time and signal corresponding to previous notes is irrelevant. This limits the different methods we can use.

% Many transcription systems use Fourier transform based methods.

This thesis builds upon a preliminary research project~\cite{ik}. In our research project, we found that Fourier transform based pitch estimation methods might not be well suited for real-time use due to fundamental limitations of the Fourier transform. In this work, we will further research if Fourier transform based methods are viable

\textcolor{gray}{The goal of the paper is to research the limits of Fourier transform based pitch estimation methods and assess if the problem is solvable (real-time monophonic AMT, research effectiveness of commonly used methods) and our focus (using Fourier and other signal processing algorithms). Note about building upon research project.}

\textcolor{gray}{Application (hexaphonic guitar pick-up to MIDI).}\\
If pitch estimation can accurately be performed in real-time, it can be used to create a digital (MIDI) instrument from an acoustic instrument. This digital instrument can then be used as an input for audio synthesizers, allowing musicians to produce sounds from a wide variety of instruments. Furthermore, accurate real-time pitch estimation can be used to automatically correct detuned instruments by pitch shifting the original signal to the closest harmonious note.
